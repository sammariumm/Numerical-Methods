# Numerical Methods Calculator

This repository will include some solutions in Numerical Methods that I can implement in several languages (as practice).

# Parabolic Interpolation

A Numerical Method for solving Optimization problems. 

# Linear Equations using Matrix Inversion (Adjoint Method)

A Numerical Method for solving linear equations through the use of matrices. This particular code focuses on the implementation of Adjoint method, to solve for the Inverted Matrix.
